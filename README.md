# Stocks coding challenge

## How to run the application

There are two apps: `stocks` and `stocks-api`.

- `stocks` is the front-end. It uses Angular 7 and Material. You can run this using `yarn serve:stocks`
- `stocks-api` uses Hapi and has a very minimal implementation. You can start the API server with `yarn serve:stocks-api`

A proxy has been set up in `stocks` to proxy calls to `locahost:3333` which is the port that the Hapi server listens on.

> You need to register for a token here: https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/ Use this token in the `environment.ts` file for the `stocks` app.

> The charting library is the Google charts API: https://developers.google.com/chart/

## Problem statement

[Original problem statement](https://github.com/tmobile/developer-kata/blob/master/puzzles/web-api/stock-broker.md)

### Task 3

```
Business requirement: As a user I want to choose custom dates
so that I can view the trends within a specific period of time.
```

_**Implement this feature and make a PR from the branch `feat_custom_dates` to `master`.**_

> Use the material date-picker component

> We need two date-pickers: "from" and "to". The date-pickers should not allow selection of dates after the current day. "to" cannot be before "from" (selecting an invalid range should make both dates the same value)

> Added from and to date pickers to fetch particular stocks data.
> Removed hardcoding values from html.
> Updated testcases.
